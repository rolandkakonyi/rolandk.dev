I set up this personal site without ever opening my laptop — while watching the Super Bowl. The whole thing was built from my phone, using OpenClaw as the helper and WhatsApp as the control surface.

The process was surprisingly smooth: I could iterate on copy, layout, and details with quick feedback loops, and push updates as soon as something felt right. It felt closer to a conversation than a traditional “sit down and code” session — which made it easy to keep momentum.

The end result is exactly what I wanted: a clean, focused site with the right amount of personality, a clear professional narrative, and room to grow. This was also a nice reminder that good tooling can change how you ship things — not just how fast, but how comfortably.

If you’re curious about this approach, I’m happy to share more. For now, I’m just glad it’s live.
