I shipped this site without opening my laptop.
While watching the Super Bowl.

I did everything from my phone with [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) in WhatsApp: tweak copy, check layout, make a change, push, repeat. No "I'll do it later when I'm at my desk." Just short loops until it felt right.

Under the hood it's [Astro](https://astro.build) + MDX on pnpm/Node 22, deployed to [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com). Nothing exotic. The unusual part was the workflow: it felt more like directing than coding.

The result is what I wanted from a personal site: clear, minimal, and not trying too hard.
Also: better tooling doesn't just make you faster. It changes when you're willing to ship.
