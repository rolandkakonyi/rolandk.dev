	<p>
		I’m Roland Kákonyi, a Senior Software Engineer in Vienna focused on media technology and developer
		platforms. I build high‑performance video playback experiences and SDKs across Apple platforms
		(iOS/tvOS/watchOS), React Native, and the web.
	</p>

	<p>
		At Bitmovin, I contribute across feature design, implementation, and production support for our
		AI‑driven video workflows (Scene Analysis) and our player technology on Apple platforms. For our Scene Analysis project,
		I leverage my expertise in Vertex AI and Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) to build powerful machine learning
		solutions for video content. I also lead development of the React Native Player SDK.
	</p>

	<p>
		I’m especially experienced in streaming and playback integrations like HLS, FairPlay Streaming,
		and Google Cast. I care about clean architecture, robust systems, and great developer experience—
		shipping products that are fast, reliable, and easy to integrate.

	<h2>Personal</h2>
	<p>
		I grew up in Hungary and currently live in Vienna, Austria. I'm a husband and father of one.
	</p>
	<p>
		In my free time, I'm an avid NFL fan, especially the Seattle Seahawks. I also enjoy action sports —
		skateboarding, snowboarding, and wave surfing are my top outdoor activities when I'm not coding.
	</p>
