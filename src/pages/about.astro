	<p>
		I’m Roland Kákonyi, a Senior Software Engineer in Vienna focused on media technology and developer
		platforms. I build high‑performance video playback experiences and SDKs across Apple platforms
		(iOS/tvOS/watchOS), React Native, and the web.
	</p>

	<p>
		At Bitmovin, I contribute across feature design, implementation, and production support for our
		AI‑driven video workflows (Scene Analysis) and our player technology on Apple platforms. I also
		lead development of the React Native Player SDK.
	</p>

	<p>
		I’m especially experienced in streaming and playback integrations like HLS, FairPlay Streaming,
		and Google Cast. I care about clean architecture, robust systems, and great developer experience—
		shipping products that are fast, reliable, and easy to integrate.
